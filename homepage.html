            <img src="https://codd.cs.gsu.edu/~kmedranocastaneda1/WP/Project1/parkinglot.gif" alt="Parking Lot Animation">
            <p>For new drivers it could be difficult to practice parking on the road, so we created this website to help visualize parking for them. About 16% of adults
               in America do not have a driver's license. While there is a myriad of reasons as to why that is, one reason is that people are timid and are afraid of
               learning to drive because it exposes them to real cars and they are worried about causing accidents. Aside from adults, there is a large portion of New
               drivers that are under the age of 18. It is also imperative for these teens to learn how to drive and the more resources there are the better.
               This website simulates cars in a parking lot driving and also parking via css animations.

            <h2>Conclusion & Future</h2>
            <p>After working on this project, we as a group have learned new methodology and have furthered developed our skills for teamwork, whether that be soft or hard skills.
                From this task, we have expanded our knowledge further about keyframes, transitions, and animations with CSS.
            </p>
            <p>For the future: For future work on this project, we can add javascript if we desire interactivity and potentially php if we would require more back end connectivity. For example, If we decided to have users create accounts,
               we would need php or some other backend language to handle the necessary additions to a server. We can add javascropt to not only this page, but other pages we may create. These new pages could be viewed as 
               'new levels' and we can use javascript to allow the user to be one of the cars. The user would then neede to maneuver correctly to avoid hitting the other cars or other obstacles and the javacript would be the way to add these new 
               functionalities.
